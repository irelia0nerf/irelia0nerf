## Founder Statement

I build non-custodial, event-driven reputation execution layers that convert on/off-chain risk signals into deterministic, auditable actions at transaction time.  
Production-grade, end-to-end on Google Cloud (Cloud Run, Pub/Sub, BigQuery, Vertex AI).  
Proven performance: p95 < 520 ms, per-route SLOs, full OpenTelemetry tracing.

**Systems & Protocols Authored:**  
- **Spezzatura Engine:** deterministic history (T² time signature)  
- **Score Sigmoid P(x):** reactive risk scoring with α dial  
- **Guardian AI:** temporal GNNs, drift guards  
- **SDID:** W3C VC + selective disclosure / ZK  
- **Veritas Protocol:** sealed rationale, DecisionID, Merkle chain  
- **Burn Engine:** Rules-as-Code, signed logs, controlled reversibility

**Core Focus:**  
- Reproducibility  
- Jurisdictional isolation  
- Compliance-by-construction  
- Explainability-by-design

## Executive Profile

Ex-lawyer (Brazil Bar 53.705/SC) and FinTech architect specialized in regulated markets, auditability, and quantum finance.  
Builder of production-grade compliance engines, explainable AI, and deterministic, cryptographically-auditable execution layers for financial services.

- **Author** of “Insider Trading: Crime de informação privilegiada”, cited as legal precedent in Buenos Aires and referenced in case law.
- **Technical Lead & Principal Engineer:**  
  - Veritas Protocol (provable audit trail, Merkle chain, DecisionID)
  - Score Engine / Spezzatura (reputational Hamiltonian, risk quantization)
  - Guardian AI (temporal GNN, drift guards, explainable compliance)
  - Burn Engine (Rules-as-Code, irreversible execution, signed logs)

## Vision & Mission

Transforming the global financial stack by replacing “black box” legacy with radical transparency, security, and adaptive intelligence — architected for regulatory certainty, real-time explainability, and data minimization by design.

> “Auditability, Security, and Trust are not features. They are systemic properties that emerge from a single, well-architected infrastructure.”

## The Compliance Trilemma: Industry Pain, Founder Solution

**Context:**  
Traditional finance is paralyzed by a trilemma:  
- The imperative to innovate and move fast  
- Relentless security and data risk  
- The overwhelming burden of compliance, audit, and privacy (LGPD/GDPR)

**Problem:**  
Legacy architectures are inherently opaque. Most “audit trails” are forensic, partial, and expensive to reconstruct. Regulators and executives live with operational uncertainty and fragmented trust.

**Founder’s Solution:**  
FoundLab is building a new market category: **Auditable Trust Infrastructure (ATI)** — not another RegTech app, but a protocol-level foundation for real-time, mathematically provable trust, designed for regulated markets.

## Architecture: Three Reinforcing Pillars

### 1. Veritas Protocol – Absolute Auditability

- Every action and decision is cryptographically chained (hash chaining), assigned a DecisionID, and logged immutably (BigQuery WORM).
- Every step is mathematically verifiable, reducing forensic audit from weeks to a single query.
- Transforms compliance and audit from reactive and manual to proactive and computational.

### 2. Zero-Persistence Security

- No sensitive client data is ever stored: all processing in ephemeral, volatile memory (Google Cloud Run, enforced TTL).
- Radical data minimization: risk is architecturally eliminated, not just encrypted.
- Demonstrates LGPD/GDPR compliance by design; shifts the question from “How is data protected?” to “Can you prove data was never stored?”

### 3. Antifragile Intelligence – The AI Flywheel

- All errors, anomalies, and interventions feed back into continuous, real-time model improvement (“Critic-Loop”).
- Self-healing, adaptive, and explainable models get better with scale and variety of edge cases.
- Proprietary data moat: every new client compounds the network effect, making the system smarter for all.

## Real-World Impact

- **Compliance cycle** time reduced: 21 hours → 16 minutes (98.7% improvement)
- **Error rate** reduced: 42% → 2.5% (94% improvement)
- **Auditability:** 100% of transactions, steps, and decisions are now provable and traceable in real time

Production-validated with clients in the BTG Pactual ecosystem and Elitte Capital.  
Recognized by Buenos Aires law journals for legal innovation in market integrity.
